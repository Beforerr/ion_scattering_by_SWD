# Questions

- [ ] Order of magnitude of estimation of the scattering rate.

- The validality of small $Îº$ in observations and its implications in quasi-adibatic approximation.
- The validality of approximate Hamiltonian form for off-center scattering.


# TODOs

- [ ] Check the algorithm for energy conservation (Boris pusher)
- [x] GPU acceleration


DynamicalSystems.jl
- Currently, the limits can not be changed with time.


- Saving as a DataFrame is more space-efficient than saving as a vector of dictionaries
