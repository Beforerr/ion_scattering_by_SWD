title: Energetic ion scattering by solar wind discontinuities
abstract: Because solar wind plasma flow transports the entire spectrum of magnetic field fluctuations (from low-frequency inertial range to electron kinetic range), it is a natural laboratory for plasma turbulence investigation. Among the various wave modes and coherent plasma structures that contribute to this spectrum, one of the most important solar wind elements is ion-scale solar wind discontinuities. These structures, which carry very intense current, have been considered as a free energy source for plasma instabilities that contribute to solar wind heating. Investigations of such discontinuities have been mostly focused on their magnetic field signatures; much less is known about their role in scattering of energetic ions. In this studay, we consider observational-based model of ion dynamics and scattering in force-free rotational magnetic discontinuities. Focusing on quantification of the scattering effect, we demonstrate that background sheared magnetic field plays an important role in determining the efficiency of pitch angle scattering. We provide a model included statistical properties of solar wind discontinuities and providing estimates of ion scattering rate.

Figure 1: two examples of discontinuity observations in ARTEMIS data (gse magnetic field, solar wind speed in gse, lmn magnetic field, ion omnidirection spectrum) with hodographs and fitting Bm(Bl)
Figure 2: distribution of kappa_m, thickness L/di, distributions of energies estimated from L=\rhoi equation
Figure 3: typical examples of ion trajectories (6 panels for different km, alpha) in 3D; use both initial z>0 and z<0 to show difference in dynamics
Figure 4: phase portraits in (kx, px) for a few km and alpha (boundaries and different colors for two/one potential wells)
Figure 5: Poincare maps for several km and alpha
Figure 6: several examples of (px_init, px_final) matrix for different km and alpha; the same matrix in pitch-angle space; most of results for z<0 (well scattered particles) and a couple examples for z>0
Figure 7: (km, alpha) space with color showing averaged over 10% variance of pitch-angle maximum (over initial px).
Figure 8, 9-10: these will be results of mapping technique for which we can use your maxtrixes. Let us discuss what do with this figures, as they should show the effective scattering rate that is more universal than pitch-angle variance

# Notations

- $B_0$: background magnetic field
- $α$: pitch angle, $w = \cos(α)$ is the pitch angle cosine
- $ψ$: gryo phase

- θ : azimuthal angle, angle between $B_N$ and $B_0$
- φ : polar angle
- β : rotation angle / 2


# TODO

The independence of the parameters from discontinuities observations

multivariate discrete non-parametric distribution
